# Pied

A pony-made vim-like editor.

## Quick start

``` sh
make run
```

## Status

Very early proof of concept. Creates a buffer and allow some moves and modifications.
At the moment, only a few vim-like controls are implemented, but the architecture allows
plugable input modes (nano, emacs, kakoune...)

- Almost no moves
- No selections
- No Open/Save file
- No command line 
- No string search
- No undo/redo
- No yank/paste
